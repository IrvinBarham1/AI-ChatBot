# About
*This is a showcase of my exploration of the concept of "Agentless" for resolving real-world software engineering problems. This endeavor aims to broaden my understanding of this concept and improve its approach.*

A brief summary, Agentless's approach is to improve AI's ability to execute end-to-end objectives/tasks in software development. The approach designed by the authors is said to have 3 phases: localization, repairing, and patching. They explain the three phases and more details about Agentless here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01489
