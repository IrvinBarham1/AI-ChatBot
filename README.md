# About
*This is a showcase of my exploration of the research of "Agentless" an approach for resolving real-world software engineering problems proposed by research students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This endeavor aims to broaden my understanding of Agentic AI and conduct my own research on this topic.*

A brief summary: Agentless's goal is to improve an AI model's ability to execute end-to-end objectives/tasks in software development. Additionally, the authors behind this research challenge the idea of the effectiveness of an agent-based model. The approach designed by the authors is said to have 3 phases: localization, repairing, and patching. They explain the three phases and more details about Agentless here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.0148

*Well, what were the results of the research?*

Notably, when the authors of this research paper released Agentless (*October 2024*) and benchmarked its performance, it ranked as the best open-source model available. Checking the leaderboard on January 2025 (*this is the leaderboard: https://www.swebench.com/index.html#lite*), an agent-based solution is ranked quite a few spots above an updated agentless model. Why is this?

Although an agentless solution can be effective, the future of AI will inevitably include agentic AIs. Moreover, Nvidia, as a leader in this space, has created a roadmap for AI's evolution that goes in this order:

Perception AI: The foundation of modern machine learning, where systems are trained to interpret and analyze data.

Generative AI: Today‚Äôs focus is on models creating text, images, and other content that are transforming industries like gaming, marketing, and media.

Agentic AI: The rise of autonomous agents capable of managing workflows, solving problems, and delivering insights.

Physical AI: The next step‚ÄîAI systems gaining embodiment to operate and interact in the physical world.

# My Plan

What I will implement here for this project is my own multi-agent AI solution that follows an organizational structure. I will use inspirations from social hierarchies in nature and corporate companies in order to design a multi-agent AI that is effective and adaptable to a broad range of problems related to software engineering.¬†
