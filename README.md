# About
*This is a showcase of my exploration of the research of "Agentless" an approach for resolving real-world software engineering problems proposed by research students at the University of Illinois at Urbana Campaign. This endeavor aims to broaden my understanding of this concept and conduct my own research on this topic.*

A brief summary, Agentless's goal is to improve an AI's model's ability to execute end-to-end objectives/tasks in software development. Additionally, the authors behind this research challenge the idea of the effectiveness of an Agent-based model. The approach designed by the authors is said to have 3 phases: localization, repairing, and patching. They explain the three phases and more details about Agentless here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.0148

*Well, what were the results of the research?*

Notably, when the authors of this research paper released Agentless (*October 2024*) and benchmarked its performance it ranked as the best open-source model available. Checking the leaderboard on January 2025 (*this is the leaderboard: https://www.swebench.com/index.html#lite*) an Agent-based solution is ranked quite a few spots above an updated Agentless model. Why is this?

Although an Agentless solution can be effective, the future of AI will inevitably include Agentic AIs. Moreover, Nividia, as leaders in ths space, has created a roadmap for AI's evolution which goes in this order:

Perception AI: The foundation of modern machine learning, where systems are trained to interpret and analyze data.
Generative AI: Today’s focus – models creating text, images, and other content that are transforming industries like gaming, marketing, and media.
Agentic AI: The rise of autonomous agents capable of managing workflows, solving problems, and delivering insights.
Physical AI: The next step – AI systems gaining embodiment to operate and interact in the physical world.

*My Plan*
What I will implement here for this project is my own multi Agentic AI solution which follows an organizational strucuture. I will use inspiriations from social heirachies in nature and coporate companies in order to design a multi Agentic AI that is effective and adaptable to a broad range of problems related to software engineering.
