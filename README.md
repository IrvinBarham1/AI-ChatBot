# About
*This is a showcase of my exploration of the research of "Agentless" an approach for resolving real-world software engineering problems proposed by research students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This endeavor aims to broaden my understanding of Agentic AI and conduct my own research on this topic.*

A brief summary: Agentless's goal is to improve an AI model's ability to execute end-to-end objectives/tasks in software development. Additionally, the authors behind this research challenge the idea of the effectiveness of an agent-based model. The approach designed by the authors is said to have 3 phases: localization, repairing, and patching. They explain the three phases and more details about Agentless here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.0148

*Well, what were the results of the research?*

Notably, when the authors of this research paper released Agentless (*October 2024*) and benchmarked its performance, it ranked as the best open-source model available. Checking the leaderboard on January 2025 (*this is the leaderboard: https://www.swebench.com/index.html#lite*), an agent-based solution is ranked quite a few spots above an updated agentless model. Why is this?

Although an agentless solution can be effective, the future of AI will inevitably include agentic AIs. Moreover, Nvidia, as a leader in this space, has created a roadmap for AI's evolution that goes in this order:

**Perception AI**: The foundation of modern machine learning, where systems are trained to interpret and analyze data.

**Generative AI**: Today’s focus is on models creating text, images, and other content that are transforming industries like gaming, marketing, and media.

**Agentic AI**: The rise of autonomous agents capable of managing workflows, solving problems, and delivering insights.

**Physical AI**: The next step—AI systems gaining embodiment to operate and interact in the physical world.

# My Plan

What I will implement here for this project is my own multi-agent AI solution that follows an organizational structure. I will use inspirations from social hierarchies in nature and corporate companies in order to design a multi-agent AI that is effective and adaptable to a broad range of problems related to software engineering. 

# My Journey
I installed Autogen and I started the process of constructing my own custom agents. I asked deepseek-r1 if it would be my emperor for my agents and it gave an incredibly detailed <a href="https://github.com/IrvinBarham1/Agentic-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/deepseek-r1.8b-llama-distill-fp16_Response%20to%20Emperor.pdf
">response</a>. I'm currently experimenting with which model I would like to be the leader and which models are good to give tasks to.
